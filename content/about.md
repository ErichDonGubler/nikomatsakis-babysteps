This blog is I post up various half-baked ideas that I have.  I work
on the [Rust programming language](http://rust-lang.org), so often --
but not always -- these ideas have to do with some aspect of Rust. I
called the blog Baby Steps mostly because I couldn't up with good
name, but also because I feel like research is a process of taking
tiny, incremental steps towards something better. If you'd like to
contact me, you can reach me at
