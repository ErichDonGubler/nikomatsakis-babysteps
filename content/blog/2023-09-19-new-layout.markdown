Some time ago I wrote about how I wanted to improve how my blog works. I recently got a spate of emails about this -- thanks to all of you! And a particular big thank you to Luna Razzaghipour, who went ahead and ported the blog over to use Hugo, cleaning up the layout a bit and preserving URLs. It's much appreciated! Hugo seems fast so far, although I will say that figuring out how to use hugo modules (so that I could preserve the atom feed...) was rather confusing! But it's all working now (I think!). I'm still interested in playing around more with the layout, but it looks much nicer, and hugo is definitely snappy! If you notice something amiss (like a link that doesn't work anymore), I'd be very grateful if you opened an issue on the [babysteps github repo]! Thanks!
