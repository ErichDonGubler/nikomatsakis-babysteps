So, a little bird told me that Rust 2024 is going to become stable today, along with Rust 1.85.0. In honor of this momentous event, I have penned a little ditty that I'd like to share with you all. Unfortunately, for those of you who remember Rust 2021's ["Edition: The song"](https://smallcultfollowing.com/babysteps/blog/2021/05/26/edition-the-song/), in the 3 years between Rust 2021 and now, my daughter was realized that her father is deeply uncool[^bound] and so I had to take this one on solo[^sorry]. Anyway, enjoy! Or, you know, suffer. As the case may be.

[^bound]: It was bound to happen eventually.

[^sorry]: Actually, I had a plan to make this a duet with somebody who shall remain nameless (they know who they are). But I was too lame to get everything done on time. In fact, I may or may not have realized "Oh, shit, I need to finish this recording!" while in the midst of a beer with Florian Gilcher last night. Anyway, sorry, would-be-collaborator-I -was-really-looking-forward-to-playing-with! Next time!

{title: Rust 2024}
{subtitle: }

{key: C}

[Verse 1]
[C] When I got functions that never return
I write an exclamation point [G]
But use it for an error that could never be
the compiler [C] will yell at me

[Verse 2]
[C] We Rust designers, we want that too
[C7] But we had to make a [F] change
[F] That will be [Fm]better
[C] Oh so much [A]better
[D] in Rust Twenty [G7]Twenty [C]Four

[Bridge]
[Am] ... [Am] But will my program [E] build?
[Am] Yes ... oh that’s [D7] for sure
[F] edi-tions [G] are [C] opt in

[Verse 3]
[C] Usually when I return an `impl Trait`
everything works out fine [G]
but sometimes I need a tick underscore
and I don’t really [C] know what that’s for

[Verse 4]
[C] We Rust designers we do agree
[C7] That was con- [F] fusing 
[F] But that will be [Fm]better
[C] Oh so much [A]better
[D] in Rust Twenty [G7]Twenty [C]Four

[Bridge 2]
[Am] Cargo fix will make the changes
automatically [G] Oh that sure sounds great...
[Am] but wait... [Am] my de-pen-denc-[E]-ies
[Am] Don’t worry e-[D7]ditions
[F] inter [G] oper [C] ate

[Verse 5]
[C] Whenever I match on an ampersand T
The borrow [G] propagates
But where do I put the ampersand
when I want to [C] copy again?

[Verse 6]
[C] We Rust designers, we do agree
[C7] That really had to [F] change
[F] That will be [Fm]better
[C] Oh so much [A]better
[D] in Rust Twenty [G7]Twenty [C]Four

[Outro]
[F] That will be [Fm]better
[C] Oh so much [A]better
[D] in Rust Twenty [G7]Twenty [C]Four

One more time!

[Half speed]
[F] That will be [Fm]better
[C] Oh so much [A]better
[D] in Rust Twenty [G7]Twenty [C]Four
